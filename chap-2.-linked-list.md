# Chap 2. Linked List

* Singly linked list: val, next
* Doubly linked list: val, next, pre \(OrderedDict in Python, LinkedHashMap in Java\)

#### Time Complexity Analysis

| Type | Insert | Delete | Update |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Singly linked list | O\(n\) | O\(n\) | O\(n\) |
| Doubly linked list | O\(1\) | O\(1\) | O\(1\) |

#### Applications:

* Reverse the linked list: store pre pointer
* Merge the linked list
* Intersected or Cycled Linked List: 1. hash 2. two pointers
* Design: 
  * insert/delete time complexity O\(1\) - linked list
  * read time complexity O\(1\) - hashmap
