### [Delete Sublist to Make Sum Divisible By K](https://binarysearch.com/problems/Delete-Sublist-to-Make-Sum-Divisible-By-K)
You are given a list of positive integers nums and a positive integer k. Return the length of the shortest sublist (can be empty sublist ) you can delete such that the resulting list's sum is divisible by k. You cannot delete the entire list. If it's not possible, return -1.

**Example 1:**

```
Input
nums = [1, 8, 6, 4, 5]
k = 7
Output
2
Explanation
We can remove the sublist [6, 4] to get [1, 8, 5] which sums to 14 and is divisible by 7.
```

**Constraints:**

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
